# Built Assets

The goal right now is too keep the build processes simple. For that reason, I've just slightly tailored the wp-scripts build process to work for this plugin's needs. In the future, a more custom webpack build would be fitting. Additionally, it would be good to not commit built files at all but rather rely on automated build processes for releases.

The individual un-built files are located within the module folders.
